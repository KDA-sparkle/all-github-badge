# GitHub Badges Guide

This repository serves as a guide to using GitHub badges in your projects. GitHub badges are small, visual indicators that you can add to your `README.md` to showcase various project metrics, statuses, and other useful information.

## üìõ How to Add a Badge

To add a badge to your `README.md`, you can use the following markdown syntax:

```
![Badge Description](https://img.shields.io/badge/Label-Value-color)
```

Replace `"Badge Description"` with a short description of the badge, and adjust the `Label`, `Value`, and `color` as needed.

For example, to display a badge that shows the version of your project, you can use:

```
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.0-blue)
```

This would render as:  
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.0-blue)
